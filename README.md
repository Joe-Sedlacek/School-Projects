# School-Projects
This repository includes some of my most recent school projects that I have saved and completed.

Project 1: I was tasked with scraping real-time stock data (ticker symbol, open price, closing price, high, low, volume, etc.) from Alpha Vantage API and inserting that data into a relational database. This project includes three files: 
    1.)DBInsert
    2.)GetCSVData
    3.)GetJSONData
    
Project 2: This project was focused on getting hands-on experience with different transfer learning methods. Two methods are used: Feature extraction, and removing and replacing the last layer of the network. This project includes one file: 
    1.)Transfer_Learning
    
Project 3: This project was focused on utlizing recurrent neural networks for text/speech prediction. Here, I use the Pulp Fiction script to train my model to learn how to predict words and characters. This project includes one file: 
    1.)Recurrent_Neural_Networks
